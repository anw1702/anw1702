## Hi there 👋

# 👋 About Me

I'm a **4th-year engineering student** deeply passionate about **emerging technologies** like:

- 🧠 Generative AI  
- 🔗 Blockchain  

My technical skillset includes:  
`Java` | `Python` | `C` | `Kotlin`

### 🛠️ Projects I’m Proud Of  
One of my favorite learning experiences was building a **simple to-do list app** using **Node.js** and **REST APIs**. It gave me hands-on exposure to backend development and practical software engineering practices.
